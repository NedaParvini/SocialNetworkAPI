# SocialNetworkAPI
The server side portion of social network API created using MongoDB and mongoose

## Description
build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
