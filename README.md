# Note Taker 

This is a Note Taker that can be used to add some Notes and Delete them.

## Installation:

Creating the Repository, Clone it.

Node.js is required to run.

npm install to install the required npm package.


## Functionality:

Usage of GET and POST are so important for this challenge.
Read, Write and Delete Functions are the most important part of the coding.
Also adding new note from req.body, push the object from req.body to the array
and Write the new array into the db.json file. 
Then we have to run the node.js file and see the result in localhost
I also created a Video which shows the process of running in Terminal and localhost.

When I run the server.js, I go to localhost port 3001, then I can see a Note Taker page and by clicking the link I go to the notes page. In notes page I can type the title of a note and text or comments for it, then Save icon appear in the navigation at the top of the page and right side. when I click the save, I can see the note and text go to the left hand column, and I will be able to write/add another note, comment in the right side.

I also can delete each note and then when I click the note title in the left hand, I can see the both title and text in the right hand.
